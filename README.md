This is a git repository for the Course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

##What to do...

* You have to unzip the source file (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive. I did it in: "C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\Archivos R\getting_data"

* Put the script in the same folder.

* The setting of the working directory is already done in the script, so don't mind if you forget.

* You can import the data to watch it, using: data <- read.table("data_set_with_the_averages.txt").
